# Git Flow

Git Flow is a branching model for managing releases.

## Branches
- `main`: Stable production code.
- `develop`: Integration branch for features.
- `feature/`: Branches for new features.
- `release/`: Branches for preparing releases.
- `hotfix/`: Branches for urgent fixes.

## Usage
- Use `git flow init` to initialize Git Flow.
- Follow the Git Flow commands for feature, release, and hotfix branches.

## Example
```bash
git flow feature start login
```
