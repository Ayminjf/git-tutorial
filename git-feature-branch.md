# Feature Branch Workflow

The feature branch workflow involves creating a new branch for each feature.

## Steps
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-login
   ```

2. Make changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add login feature"
   ```

3. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-login
   ```

4. Open a pull request (PR) for review.


## Explanation
- Keeps the main branch stable.

- Encourages collaboration and code reviews.
